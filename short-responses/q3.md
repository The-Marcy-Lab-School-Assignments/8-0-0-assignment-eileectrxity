# Question

`app.get(endpoint, controller)` takes in a `controller` as the second argument.

What is a controller?

# Answer

A controller is the callback function that handles a given request and decides what to do in order to process it and send back the response. It has logic behind it like any other function or model method and is akin to a handler funciton.

A controller is a callback function that analyses a request (parsing) and sends a response for a speicifc endpoint.
