# Question

`app.get(endpoint, controller)` takes in an `endpoint` as the first argument.

What is an endpoint in Express?

# Answer

In Express, an endpoint is the resource path, aka where you send requests to in order to get specific data back. The endpoint is what we're tacking on the back of our server URL. For example, in restful api conventions, this would look like `/api/data-resource/:resource-id`. Whenever a client visits our app at that endpoint (url), then our server that if on, will be listening and see a HTTP request was made to the endpoint and so it will invoke the controller defined with the route in response to the request.

An endpoint in Express is a specific URL path in the server that cilents can send request to perform CRUD(create, read, update, and delete) capabilities following the REST artitecture.
