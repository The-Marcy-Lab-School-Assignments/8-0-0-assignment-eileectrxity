# Question

What is the job of a server application?

# Answer

A server application's job is to listen to incoming requests from the client/frontend, and decide how to handle them, sending back responses. It can also host static assets such as our minified frontend app from our dist build.

If using express, the express app from invoking express() provides us with methods such as app.get, app.patch, app.post, app.put, app.delete, and app.use.

The job of a server application is to listen in for requests and send back responses in the form of data or static files from the requests. Depending on the requests, there will be different responses such as serving/fetching/managing data.
